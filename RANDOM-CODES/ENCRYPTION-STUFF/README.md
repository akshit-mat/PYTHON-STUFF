# ENCRYPTION
This is just some code i wrote while i was learning morse code and other types of encryptions

## There are two programs in this Repository
### - MORSE CODE
This is a simple morse code encoder and decoder
This is the format for encoding: (separate alphabets by space and words by /)
```
- .... .. ... / .. ... / .- / ... .- -- .--. .-.. .
```

### - MY ENCRYPTION

-O-5-
