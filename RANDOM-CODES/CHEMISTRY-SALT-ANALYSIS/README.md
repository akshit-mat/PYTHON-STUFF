# 👩🏻‍🔬⚗️ CHEMISTRY SALT ANALYSIS 🧪🥼
A Python-based educational tool that simulates the process of qualitative inorganic salt analysis, focusing on anion identification through various chemical tests.

## 🔍 Overview

This project simulates the traditional chemistry lab practical of salt analysis, specifically focusing on anion tests. It randomly selects an anion and challenges users to identify it by performing various chemical tests virtually, similar to how they would in a real chemistry laboratory.

## ⭐ Features

- Random selection of anions for analysis
- Step-by-step testing process
- Real-time feedback on test results
- Educational hints
- Multiple anions including:
  - co32-, no2-, so32-, s2-, cl-, br-, i-, ch3coo-, no3-, so42-, po43-
<br/>(yes i know this is not the ideal way to represent anions but its definitely easier to code)

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Run the program (by copy-pasting on a python compiler)

2. The program will randomly select an anion for analysis

3. Perform tests by adding stuff in the test tube (all the available stuff is given below)
   - dil h2so4
   - conc h2so4
   - feso4
   - water (to make an original solution of the given salt)
   - bacl2
   - conc hno3
   - ammonium molybdate

5. Based on the results of your tests, deduce which anion is present

6. Submit your final answer to check if you correctly identified the anion

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Random module (built-in)
- sys module (built-in)

## 📚 Educational Value

This simulator helps students:
- Practice salt analysis in a safe, virtual environment
- Learn the systematic approach to qualitative analysis
- Understand chemical reactions and their observations
- Prepare for actual laboratory practicals from homes

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add confirmatory reactions... currently this program only has preliminary analysis for anion determination
- Include cation testing simulation
- Add visual representations of reactions
- Implement a scoring system
- Add detailed explanations of chemical reactions
- Include solubility rules and chemical equations

Created as a 12th-grader to practice salt analysis from home (as I hadn't attended enough chemistry practical classes)
