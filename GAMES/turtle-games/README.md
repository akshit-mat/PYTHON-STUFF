# Minesweeper Prototype 🐢
This is not really "the final version" of this game but i was too short-attention-spaned to complete it <br/>(it still works and is kinda cool)

## 🎮 Working ⚙️
This game is based on turtle module in python. I first created a grid of 5x5 and then used the coordinate system of turtle to define the boxes. Then using random module, a random box is chosen which is set of colour blue and all other boxes are set of colour red... now you just have to click on boxes to reveal their colour and try to find the blue box.
