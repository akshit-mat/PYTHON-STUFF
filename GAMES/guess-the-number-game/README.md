# GUESS THE NUMBER GAMES ðŸŽ²
This is one of the first games i built on python (pretty basic i'd say)

## ðŸŽ® I made two versions of this game:
### - Classic Version ðŸ•¹
where the number is chosen randomly between 1 to 10 and you have to guess in the minimum number of attempts

### - Difficulty Level Version ðŸŽ¯
where the game asks you to choose difficulty: easy, medium and hard which choose numbers between 1 to 10, 1 to 100 and 1 to 500 respectively

## ðŸ”§ Requirements and Libraries used
- python>=3.10
- No external libraries are required for random module
