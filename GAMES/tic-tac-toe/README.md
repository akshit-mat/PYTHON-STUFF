# ❌ THE GAME OF TIC-TAC-TOE ⭕
this game is kind of close to me (not in a sexual way)...
this is legit the purest form of BRUTE FORCE coding, to sum up this code... this is just a bunch of if elif statements disguised as a game.

(in my defense i didn't know about the def statement at the time of making this)

## 🎮 I made three versions of this game:
### - Player vs Player 🕹
this is a 1v1 tic tac toe where you enter your name and then the code asks you for the position where you want to play and then the next player's turn comes 

### - Player vs Environment 🎯
this is a PvE game based on random module... (so there's a high chance of win... unless unlucky)

### - Player vs Environment (IMPOSSIBLE) 😈
this however... is BRUTE FORCE.

about this, i just picked up a notebook and decided to write every possible outcome of a tic tac toe match (the pic of the page is attached) and then i coded all possible outcomes and turns into if else statements (yes this is the inefficient part). 
<br/>
anyways its impossible to beat (there's only two possible outcomes: either the computer wins or its a draw)

to summarize this... the computer just plays exactly like how i would play in a 1v1 match of tic-tac-toe

## 🔧 Requirements and Libraries used

### - for PvP
- python>=3.10
- No external libraries are required for sys module

### - for PvE
- python>=3.10
- No external libraries are required for sys module and random module

### - for PvE with scoreboard
- python>=3.10
- No external library for sys module

P.S. this is a very NON-user-friendly code if you write something wrong it just ends the program lol (irony is... the only module i've imported is to make the code non user friendly)
